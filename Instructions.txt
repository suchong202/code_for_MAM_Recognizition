One、Conventional classifier
1、The xlsx files used in the classifier.py file are in the "classifier" folder in “Data"
2、Run classifier.py to get the classification effect under the traditional classifier

Two、Multi-scale feature extraction and AWA feature fusion code
1、Data set preparation：run data_divide.py，The paths of the training and test data are stored in the cls_train_fusion.txt and cls_test_fusion.txt files, respectively.
2、Run train.py for network training
3、Run test.py to test the training effect
4、Instructions: fusion_model.py stores the programs that train.py needs to call, including feature fusion and feature extraction methods

Three、Vertical pixel projection
1、ty.m is matlab code for calculating vertical pixel projections
2、VerticalProject.m is the calculation formula for the vertical pixel projection, which is called in the ty.m file

Four、Fitted line
1、run line.py

Five、U-Net segmentation
1、Run the annotation.py file and store the paths of the training and test data in the files cls_train.txt and cls_test.txt, respectively
2、Run the utrain.py file to train the network
3、The segmented muscle ultrasound video was obtained by running upredict.py

Six、model_data
Some models initialize parameter files for reference

Seven、logs
There are some of the weighting documents for ablation experiments for reference
